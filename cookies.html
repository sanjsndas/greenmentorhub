    <h1>Cookies Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: July 1, 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to GreenMentor Hub's Cookies Policy page. Our website uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience and improve our services. Below you will find 40 detailed points explaining how we use cookies, what types we use, your rights related to cookies, and information on how you can manage your cookie preferences easily. We believe in transparency and aim to provide you comprehensive information to make informed decisions.</p>

    <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are text files containing small pieces of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. These cookies help websites remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period to provide a smoother and more personalized browsing experience. Without cookies, functionality may be limited, and websites may not remember your preferences.</p>
    <p>At GreenMentor Hub, cookies enable us to recognize your device and improve your user experience, allowing smooth navigation and efficient access to secure areas, like member dashboards and payment options. We use cookies to tailor our site offerings to your interests and preferences, making your interactions faster and more satisfying.</p>

    <h2>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
    <p>We employ several types of cookies on our website, broadly categorized as essential, performance, functionality, and targeting cookies. Essential cookies are fundamental for our website operation, such as session maintenance and security. Performance cookies collect anonymous data on how users interact with our website so we can improve its functionality. Functionality cookies remember choices such as your region or language preferences to personalize your experience. Targeting cookies collect data to deliver relevant marketing content.</p>
    <p>Each category plays a vital role in enhancing your experience and our ability to provide tailored services and content. We invite you to read further details on each cookie type to understand their function and importance.</p>

    <h2>3. Essential Cookies</h2>
    <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to enable core functionality like secure login, navigation, and access to protected content. They do not collect personal data for marketing or tracking purposes. Essential cookies help you navigate pages smoothly and safely, preventing security risks by authenticating users and protecting against fraud.</p>
    <p>Disabling essential cookies may impact your ability to access certain services and features, and your overall experience might be limited. They are crucial to the website’s basic operations and ensure a secure and consistent user environment.</p>

    <h2>4. Performance and Analytics Cookies</h2>
    <p>To better understand how visitors engage with our website, we use performance cookies that track anonymized data such as the pages you visit, time spent, and navigation paths. This data helps us identify popular content, detect issues like broken links or slow loading, and optimize site performance.</p>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics providers to collect this information under strict privacy controls to improve user satisfaction while respecting your privacy rights. This data does not personally identify individuals and is aggregated for statistical purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Functionality Cookies</h2>
    <p>Functionality cookies remember preferences and settings you select during site visits, such as language choices or display options. They allow the website to provide enhanced features, for example, by personalizing content, recalling your workshop registrations, and offering tailored advice based on your interests.</p>
    <p>These cookies contribute to a customized browsing experience and enable site features that suit your individual preferences for convenience and ease of use during your interactions with us.</p>

    <h2>6. Targeting and Advertising Cookies</h2>
    <p>These cookies enable us and trusted partners to present advertisements relevant to your interests both on our website and on other platforms. They gather data about your browsing behavior over time and across different sites to create a profile of interests, which allows displaying tailored marketing messages that are more likely to be of value to you.</p>
    <p>Such cookies require your explicit consent. You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time and opt out of behavioral advertising if you wish, using settings in our cookie dialog or via browser controls.</p>

    <h2>7. Cookie Consent and Your Control</h2>
    <p>We respect your choice to accept or decline cookies other than those essential for the website to function. Our cookie consent banner provides a clear option to accept or decline non-essential cookies. Your preferences are stored and respected in your subsequent visits to give you control over your privacy while still enjoying our services.</p>
    <p>You can also change your cookie preferences at any time through your browser settings or by contacting GreenMentor Hub. We provide guidance and support to help you manage these options effectively.</p>

    <h2>8. How to Manage Cookies in Your Browser</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers provide comprehensive tools to manage cookies by allowing you to view, delete, block, or allow all or specific cookies. These options are typically found under the privacy or security settings menu of your browser.</p>
    <p>We recommend familiarizing yourself with these controls to customize your browsing experience according to your comfort with data sharing and privacy. Keep in mind that blocking cookies might impact site performance or disable certain features.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>GreenMentor Hub uses select third-party services to provide functionalities such as analytics, payment processing, and social media integration. These providers may place their own cookies on your device which are governed by their policies. We vet these providers to ensure compliance with privacy laws and include mechanisms for you to control or opt out of third-party cookie usage.</p>
    <p>Examples include Google Analytics for site performance insights, social networks for sharing, and marketing platforms for tailored advertisements.</p>

    <h2>10. Cookie Duration</h2>
    <p>Cookies can be session-based or persistent. Session cookies are temporary and deleted after you close your browser, allowing temporary functionalities such as login sessions or shopping carts. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you clear them and help remember preferences across multiple visits.</p>
    <p>The duration varies depending on cookie type and purposes; for instance, essential session cookies last for single session, whereas marketing cookies commonly persist for months or years to track and personalize effectively.</p>

    <h2>11. Data Protection and Cookies</h2>
    <p>Data collected by cookies is handled responsibly and securely in compliance with applicable data protection regulations including GDPR and CCPA. We implement technical and organizational safeguards such as encryption and tight access controls to protect any personal data derived from cookies.</p>
    <p>Your data is used only for specified purposes as outlined in this policy and our privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information and limit access to authorized personnel and service providers who adhere to strict confidentiality standards.</p>

    <h2>12. How Cookies Improve Your Experience</h2>
    <p>Cookies play an essential role in making your interaction with GreenMentor Hub efficient and enjoyable. They help us remember your login status, keep your favorite settings like language or layout, suggest workshops and content tailored to your interests, and enable quick navigation throughout our site without repeated entries.</p>
    <p>By facilitating continuity across sessions and delivering relevant information, cookies ensure that your experience is both engaging and smoother, saving your time and enhancing satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>13. Cookies and Mobile Devices</h2>
    <p>On mobile devices, cookies function similarly as on PCs or laptops, though their behavior can be affected by mobile operating systems and browser apps. Our website is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring cookie-based functions such as login persistence, user preferences, and security features work seamlessly on smartphones and tablets.</p>
    <p>We encourage mobile users to keep cookies enabled to benefit from the full range of services and personalized experiences we offer.</p>

    <h2>14. Legal Basis for Cookie Use</h2>
    <p>GreenMentor Hub relies on your consent to use non-essential cookies such as marketing and analytics cookies, in full compliance with privacy laws like GDPR. Essential cookies operate under the legal basis of legitimate interest as they are critical for service provision.</p>
    <p>You have the right to manage any cookie consents at any time and can refuse marketing cookies without affecting the essential functions of our website.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes to Our Cookie Policy</h2>
    <p>We may periodically update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in our practices or new legal requirements. We recommend reviewing this page regularly to stay informed of our cookie use. Substantial amendments will be clearly communicated through our website or email alerts to ensure transparency and continued user control.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of our website following any policy changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>16. Cookies Used for Security</h2>
    <p>Some cookies are dedicated to maintaining the security of our website and users. These prevent fraudulent activities, detect bots, and protect our systems from malicious access attempts. Security cookies support the integrity of login sessions and secure transactions, reducing vulnerability to hacking or data theft.</p>
    <p>Such cookies operate behind the scenes and do not track your behavior beyond safeguarding your data and our infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>17. Cookies for Login and Authentication</h2>
    <p>To remember that you are signed in as a genuine user, authentication cookies are used during your visit. They securely identify your session and prevent unauthorized access. These cookies allow you to navigate the site without needing to sign in repeatedly for each page or action.</p>
    <p>They are essential for service continuity and protecting your account from unauthorized use.</p>

    <h2>18. Customization Cookies</h2>
    <p>Customization cookies enable us to adjust the website's appearance and operation according to your choices. You might select dark mode, font size, or region preferences, and these cookies remember and apply those settings automatically on return visits.</p>
    <p>These cookies improve accessibility and tailor our services to your personal needs and comfort.</p>

    <h2>19. Performance Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Through performance cookies, we monitor page speed, server response time, and compatibility with different browsers or devices. This ongoing monitoring helps us prioritize improvements, reduce errors, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
    <p>Your anonymously collected data supports better technology decisions and faster service delivery.</p>

    <h2>20. Advertising and Analytics Partners</h2>
    <p>We collaborate with trusted third-party advertising and analytics partners, including Google Analytics and social media platforms. These entities set cookies to analyze user interactions, measure campaign effectiveness, and deliver targeted advertisements, all while respecting your privacy rights and providing opt-out mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Partner compliance with data protection laws is regularly reviewed to maintain security standards.</p>

    <h2>21. Behavioral Advertising</h2>
    <p>Behavioral advertising cookies build anonymous profiles based on your browsing habits to display relevant ads that may interest you. By understanding your preferences and activity patterns, these cookies help us serve marketing materials that are more personalized, reducing irrelevant advertisements and enhancing your online experience.</p>
    <p>Consent is required before activating these cookies, and you can opt out at any time.</p>

    <h2>22. Social Media Integration</h2>
    <p>Our website includes social media sharing features powered by platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These features may install cookies enabling you to interact with content, share information, and participate in social media activities seamlessly.</p>
    <p>Cookies related to social media are governed by the respective platform's privacy policies and cookie usages.</p>

    <h2>23. Cookie Policy Scope</h2>
    <p>This Cookie Policy applies to all digital interactions with GreenMentor Hub, including our main website, mobile apps, and any affiliated online platforms. It governs our use of cookies and related technologies in these environments, ensuring consistent privacy practices across our services.</p>
    <p>Offline services and interactions may have separate privacy terms.</p>

    <h2>24. How We Use Collected Data</h2>
    <p>Data collected through cookies enables us to analyze visitor behavior, improve site content and layout, troubleshoot issues, and tailor marketing. We use aggregated and anonymized data to generate insights that guide business and technical decisions.</p>
    <p>Your personal data is never sold or shared without explicit consent and is used solely in accordance with this and our privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>25. Opt-Out Options</h2>
    <p>Users can opt out from non-essential cookies including analytics and marketing cookies via our cookie consent banner or browser settings. Refusing cookies may limit personalization and advertising effectiveness but will not affect core website functionality.</p>
    <p>We recommend regularly reviewing your consent preferences to stay in control of your data.</p>

    <h2>26. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h2>
    <p>Disabling cookies can result in reduced website performance and functionality. Features like saved logins, preferences, or shopping carts may not work correctly, requiring repeated manual input or re-authentication.</p>
    <p>We strive to balance privacy with usability to provide you meaningful control without sacrificing ease of use.</p>

    <h2>27. Managing Cookies via Browser Settings</h2>
    <p>Browsers allow inspection, blocking, or deletion of cookies. Consult the help resources for browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge to learn management methods. Remember that overly restrictive settings may disrupt navigation and interactive elements on GreenMentor Hub.</p>
    <p>Our site assists you with notices and controls helping to apply your choices.</p>

    <h2>28. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
    <p>Currently, GreenMentor Hub does not respond to Do Not Track browser signals due to inconsistent industry standards. We prioritize transparent consent mechanisms ensuring your preferences are respected effectively.</p>
    <p>We encourage users to employ our cookie banner choices for managing tracking.</p>

    <h2>29. Consent Duration</h2>
    <p>Your cookie consent choice is saved for one year from the date you make it. After expiration, you will be prompted again to review your preferences. This ensures ongoing compliance and usability tailored to your current choices.</p>
    <p>You can change your consent at any time through the dialog or browser settings.</p>
